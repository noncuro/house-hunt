   *
   *  A shortlist, a places list or a sweep left over from the hunt you switched away from is the
   *  failure the spec names outright: nothing from the previous project may remain on screen.
   *  Not `invalidateQueries()`: invalidation leaves the old rows painted until the refetch lands,
   *  and those rows are another project's flats. The reply carries the new state, so the shell does
   *  not have to ask again for it.
   *
   *  The order below is load-bearing, and getting it wrong is why this button did nothing at all.
   *  `client.clear()` removes every query from the cache *without notifying its observers*, so the
   *  mounted `useAuth` is left holding an orphaned query while the `setQueryData` after it builds a
   *  fresh one that nothing is watching. Zero notifications, so the shell never re-renders: the
   *  switch lands in the database and the screen keeps naming the hunt you just left. Sign-out runs
   *  the same two lines and survives only because it is called from the component that reads the
   *  auth query, so its own state change re-renders it and `useQuery` re-attaches on the way past.
   *  This is a leaf, and gets no such rescue.
   *
   *  So: write the auth state into the query that already exists, which does notify, and *reset*
   *  the rest rather than removing it. Reset keeps the observers attached and hands them
   *  `undefined` before their refetch lands, which is what the spec asks for — the previous hunt's
